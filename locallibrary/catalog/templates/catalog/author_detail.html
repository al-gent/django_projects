  <!-- book.bookinstance_set.all is a new one: 
    it is needed because we declared a ForeignKey field only in the many side of the relationship, the book.bookinstance
    We didnt do anything to declare the relationship to the Book in the model, so django doesnt have any field to get the set of
    assosciated records - django constructs a 'reverse lookup' function - lower-case the model name where the ForeignKey was declared
    followed by _set -->
